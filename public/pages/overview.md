## Abstract

I have a diverse array of experiences due to my schools comprehensive curriculum and have been exposed to many information and technology concepts and worked on various collaborative projects, all while keeping myself ranked at the 0.5% of my class and maintaining a 3.91 GPA.

I have a wide breadth of knowledge, which allows me unique perspective in insight in design processes. Having had past Data Science and Project Management experiences, my enjoyment for Informatics programming & web development coursework led to my switch to SWE as a junior. I am working hard to improve my depth in knowledge within Software Engineering and Full-Stack development constantly by creating new projects, ds & a studies, and applying constantly to professional opportunities with hopes to get real world experience.
## My past experiences include...
- data science research at the `University of Washington iSchool`
- joining a early stage startup
    - [demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E3RMj1VQJsf88n7w_UBeUrNy6aN7ILdR/view?usp=sharing) & [fl '22](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/founders-live_entrepreneurship-university-startup-activity-6936115184696516608-UNzT?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

- translate my notion writings and essays into a blog targeting the importance of information access to all

## Why Informatics?
I measure my success through my ability to give back and help others, especially those in less fortunate situations then mine, and use the synthesis of my domain knowledge within academia, information systems, and advising to research ways to enable better information access to minorities and the less fortunate. My goal is to bridge the information gap between those with money and those without by researching ways to provide better information to all. This all would not have been possible to happen without Informatics. **Information is power.**
