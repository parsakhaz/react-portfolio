## Abstract

I have a diverse array of experiences due to my schools comprehensive curriculum and have been exposed to many information and technology concepts and worked on various collaborative projects, all while keeping myself ranked at the 0.5% of my class and maintaining a 3.93 GPA.

I have a wide breadth of knowledge, which allows me unique perspective and insight in design processes. Having had past Data Science and Project Management experiences, my enjoyment for Informatics programming & web development coursework led to my switch to SWE as a junior. I am working hard to improve my depth in knowledge within Software Engineering and Full-Stack development constantly by creating new projects, studying ds&a, and TAing for development courses at UWS.

## My past experiences include...

- joining a early stage startup: coursefinder.fyi `now defunct`
