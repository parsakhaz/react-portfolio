## Abstract

I have a diverse array of experiences due to my schools comprehensive curriculum and have been exposed to many information and technology concepts and worked on various collaborative projects, all while keeping myself ranked at the 0.5% of my class and maintaining a 3.93 GPA.

My experiences give me a wide breadth of knowledge, which allows me unique perspective and insight in design processes. Despite unrelated Data Science and Consulting experiences, they played a vital part in me realizing my passion for the design and development of anything from [data scrapers & static websites, to rest APIs & full stack applications](https://parsas.studio/#/projects). I've juggled the roles of developer, designer, and leader. I am constantly learning and leading design, development, and leadership projects through the UW iSchool, freelancing, club leadership, volunteer work, working as a teacher assistant and [more](https://parsas.studio/#/projects). At any given moment you can find me juggling 3-5 projects... all while working part-time, maintaining my gpa, and spending my free time with those who matter most to me.

## Currently I am...

- teacher assistant for `info 340: client-side development` at `university of washington iSchool`
- `dubhacks next '22` Batch 2 `Entrepreneur in Residence`
- project lead for technical capstone, leading 5 people to work directly with `CEO` of `Ada Developer Academy` to revamp website and shift away from WordPress by creating a website with a web framework 

## My past experiences include...

- data science research at the `University of Washington iSchool`

## In the future...

- create volunteer tab to include my volunteer work (Digital Designer @ UW Persian Club (logo, website), Volunteer @ Internet Activism, Beta Tester @ Code Stitch, Armenian School (website), etc)
- progress on various side-projects, but prioritize `Next` `EiR project`

## If you somehow got this far

I'll share you a little secret... 

I'm a 19 year-old graduating senior. Not at a High School. At UW, as an Informatics major & first-gen college student (and before you make any assumptions, I qualify for financial aid - my parents are not rich, but are incredibly supportive which I am blessed to have). If you want to make the most of your high school and college experiences, or just chat, reach out to me on LinkedIn or by email @ khazapar7@gmail.com and we can talk. I'd be happy to share what I'd do differently if I could go back, and my personal roadmap (most applicable to tech, but also any generally competitive major). Looking forward to hearing from you!
It goes without saying that my environment & luck played an incredibly large part in this, and I have a lot to be grateful for in many regards. I plan to direct my efforts after college towards sharing my own insights and wisdom from my journey and let it be a compass to others in theirs.   -->
